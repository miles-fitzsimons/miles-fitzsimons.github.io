          <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
          <p>
            The DBC/EDA is an alternative education in web development aimed at people from all walks of life in all different stages of their career (as a web developer or otherwise). Though the model has been emulated elsewhere, my research indicated that EDA is considered the best programming bootcamp in Australasia. Some of the other companies appear to be criticised for being concerned with only money and not the quality of the skills of their graduates. This does not appear to be the case with EDA.

          <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
          <p>
            Thus far I am very impressed. The application and pre-phase-zero processes have gone smoothly. I also get the impression that EDA is very concerned with the quality of the skills of its graduates and not simply a money farm. EDA also appears to be concerned with helping its graduates obtain employment upon graduation.

          <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
          <p>
            Very well. Joshua explained in our orientation session that we will find ourselves learning from people in cohorts ahead us, learning with our co-cohertees, and teaching people in the cohorts coming behind us. I know from previous experience that studying with your peers and teaching others are both effective ways to learn. I look forward to participating in this environment. And all of this is on top of learning from the EDA teachers!

          <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
          <p>
            I am typically initially wary of institutions that I have not interacted with before and was unsure how EDA would perform. However, my fears have been completely alleviated in view of the excellent administration process I have experienced thus far. The application, interview, invoicing and orientation processes were all flawless. I now have faith that EDA will perform well during my time with them.

          <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
          <p>
            As foreshadowed above, I am excited to participate in the EDA learning environment. I believe learning from your peers and teaching others is a great way to learn.
