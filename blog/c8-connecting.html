					<h4>Empathic Listening</h4>
					<p>
						I try to practice empathic listening in my day to day life. I think it is useful to try to consider things from another person's point of view so that you can construct a more-rounded response and avoid conflict. We should try to remember that fundamentally we are all the same.

					<h4>Political Awareness Exercise</h4>
					<p>
						I have recently moved back to New Zealand and in doing so need to do a lot of 'life administration'. One particular task includes ordering a new debit card from the bank. This has not been a smooth process and two months later I am still waiting for the card. I have been in conflict with the bank during this process.<br><br>I argue that ordering a new card should be a very simple, automated process. From the bank's point of view, new cards are ordered repeatedly. Updating my address online should flow through to the bank's card system. Calling the bank to ensure that the second card isn't sent to Melbourne should result in correct action. Calling the bank (and escalating the issue up the chain) should ensure that the third card isn't sent to Melbourne. Although the third card wasn't sent to Melbourne, it was still sent to the wrong address. You are a bank, have unfathomable amounts of cash in reserve and essentially a licence to print money. Why are your systems broken and your staff undertrained?<br><br>The bank would argue that it's unfair that I don't understand that it is a huge, complex organisation and that their systems are broken and their staff undertained, regardless of the resources available to it.
