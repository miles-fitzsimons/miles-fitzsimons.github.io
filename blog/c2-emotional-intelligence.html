        <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
        <h6>15 April 2016</h6>

        <article>  
          <h4>What learnings did you take from chapter one of 'Search Inside Yourself'?</h4>
          <p>
            I was already aware of the concept of emotional intelligence, but the book (if it is to be believed – that is the cynical scientist in me coming out) reinforces the importance of it in work, family and everyday life. However, in line with the book, I do believe that creating a positive work environment can have tremendous benefits in both happiness and the bottom line. My belief comes from experiencing both positive and hostile work environments. I think I (subconciously) responded to both environments as one would expect.<br><br>I like the fact that the book has been written by an engineer and is deeply rooted in science. I liked the concept of mindfulness of the body and its associated anecdotes. In particular, the story from Malcolm Gladwell's 'Blink' (a book I read years ago) regarding people's intuition in gambling with loaded decks was fascinating. Maybe we could more deeply tap into our intuition if we could be more mindful of our body's reaction to situations (e.g, sweaty palms when picking up a bad card).<br><br>I also liked the following quotes: 'if there is a one-word summary of everything I just said (hint: there is), that word is <em>optimize</em>' and  'all you really need to do is to pay attention moment-to-moment without judging'.

          <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
          <p>
            I initially attempted the 'easy' (i.e, focus on your breathing) two minutes of mindfulness. I found it to be an interesting experience.<br><br>I set a timer for two minutes and shut my eyes. My mind did occasionally wander (e.g, what am I going to write in my blog?) but I managed to bring it back to focusing on my breathing. I think for a small period I even managed to think about.. nothing. The two minutes passed faster than I expected.<br><br>I have been contemplating undertaking the two minutes of meditation per day exercise, though have not yet started. Maybe I just did.
