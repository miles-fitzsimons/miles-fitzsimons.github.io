      <h3 class="blogQ">Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p class="blogA">
        I am a long-time user of the pomodoro technique and found it useful in my previous career. However, I have not had a problem focusing on the task at hand during week 1 of phase zero and so have not needed to use it. I also found myself reflecting on EDA work this week when I had some downtime, for example, sitting on a bus or before falling asleep.
      </p>
      <h3 class="blogQ">What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p class="blogA">
        I found the <a class="bodylink" href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-to-declutter-your-mind-and-regain-your-focus">5 Ways to De-clutter Your Mind and Regain Your Focus article</a> particularly interesting. I feel I (at least subconciously) already do some of these things. It may be a good idea to start actively thinking about them. Interestingly, point 5 seems closely related to reflecting on our (good and bad) experiences. Further, I am interested in meditation thought have never tried it. The two-minute-per-day concept interests me a lot.
      </p>
      <h3 class="blogQ">What worked for you?</h3>
      <p class="blogA">
        Reflecting on my experiences has been a great help. Thinking about my tasks has recuded stress levels and helped me prepare for the next day.
      </p>
      <h3 class="blogQ">Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p class="blogA">
        I intend to follow the points in the '5 way' article mentioned above. If I find my mind wandering I will start using the pomodoro technique again.
