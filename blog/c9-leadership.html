					<h4>My experience with compassionate (or not so much) leadership</h4>
					<p>
						I have worked at a number of different companies with a number of different bosses in my life. One boss stands out as not being compassionate and one other boss stands out as being particularly compassionate.<br><br>
						The non-compassionate boss, though brilliant in his field, was a micro-manager and didn't trust all of his staff to do their jobs. I pushed back against the micro management and eventually gained his trust and so was given my freedom. However, other people in the organisation were not treated this way. From what I hear, most left.
						<br><br>
						In contrast my compassionate boss put his trust in me from day one and left me to my own devices. However, it was made very clear that help or advice related to work or otherwise was always available and would always be given. I took my boss up on this countless times.

					<h4>The SCARF model</h4>
					<p>
						The SCARF (status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness and fairness) model is an interesting concept, which I have never come across before. I think I am fairly unconcerned with status in the traditional sense but can be quite hard on myself (i.e, my personal status). Certainty is something I have always sought and worked hard to achieve. Quitting my job, returning to NZ and enrolling at EDA has led me to one of the most uncertain periods of my life. However, I am comfortable with the uncertainty because I know that if EDA and web development doesn't work out, I can always return to my old career.
						<br><br>
						Autonomy is something I have always desired and often received. I don't react well when my autonomy is taken away, and this is something I will need to work on in the future, especially during bootcamp. Relatedness, which is described as a sense of safety with others is something that is important to me. During phase zero I have been interacting with my cohort mainly on slack, but have also met a few cohort members for coffees and pair programming. Everybody seems nice, interesting, intelligent and keen to share their knowledge. Finally, fairness is important to me too. It is something I am willing to fight for, especially if unfairness effects me personally.

					<h4>A difficult conversation</h4>
					<p>
					I had a difficult conversation with one of the EDA teachers this week about my concern of lack of assignments and resources for week 9 of phase zero and also some of my concerns about bootcamp. We both spoke and listened well and most of fears have been alleviated. I am looking forward to bootcamp!
